       "'1.1 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SYSTEMA computer is an electronic device that can be \\nprogrammed to accept data (input), process it and \\n\\ngenerate result (output). A computer along with \\n\\nadditional hardware and software together is called a \\n\\ncomputer system.  A computer system primarily comprises a central \\nprocessing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices \\n\\nand storage devices. All these components function \\ntogether as a single unit to deliver the desired output. \\nA computer system comes in various forms and sizes. \\n\\nIt can vary from a high-end server to personal desktop, \\n\\nlaptop, tablet computer, or a smartphone. Figure 1.1 shows the block diagram of a computer \\nand signal between the components. 1.1.1 Central Processing Unit (CPU)It is the electronic circuitry of a computer that carries \\nout the actual processing and usually referred as the \\nbrain of the computer. It is commonly called processor \\n\\nalso. Physically, a CPU can be placed on one or more \\n\\nmicrochips called integrated circuits (IC). The ICs \\n\\ncomprise semiconductor materials. ﬁA computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human.ﬂ ŒAlan TuringC˜˚˛˝˙ˆ 1\\n Cˇˆ S˘\\nIn this chapter »Introduction to Computer System »Evolution of \\nComputer  »Computer Memory  »Data Transfer \\nbetween Memory \\nand CPU »Data and \\nInformation »Microprocessors »Software »Operating SystemFigure 1.1: Components of a computer systemSecondary Storage DevicesInput DeviceControl Unit (CU)Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)Primary MemoryOutput DeviceCentral Processing Unit (CPU)Ch 1.indd   108-Apr-19   11:36:15 AM'"
